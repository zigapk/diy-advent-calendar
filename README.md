This repository contains blueprints for a DIY advent calendar using a laser cutter.

The designs were created in Inkscape. Original files are saved in SVG format, while files for cutting are exported in DXF format.

## Instructions
1. **Cut the following parts:**
    - 1x wooden `base` (thin wood, 2-3 mm is sufficient).
    - Multiple middle parts: `middle` (I cut 6 middle plates of 4 mm thickness each).
    - 1x cardstock `adventni_top_small`. On the laser cutter, set the graphics to cutting mode (as high speed and low power as possible, if you cutter even allows for this). This makes for a faster production and looks cleaner in my opinion.
2. Sand and clean all layers.
3. Glue the wooden layers together.
4. Fill the calendar with small gifts. I went for various sweets, soaps, a candle and even managed to stuff some socks in there.
5. Glue the cardstock layer to the wooden layers.

## Notes:
- The top layer (paper) is slightly misaligned and needs to be redrawn.
- Instead of using dashed paths in Inkscape, consider using the laser's dashed line feature to speed up the cutting process.
